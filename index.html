        <strong>It</strong> is so, hard to phantom the amount of events that have occurred in my life; and even greater, the changes that followed after.  The events are kind of like the famous inquiry, for many generations, "Did the chicken come before the egg; or did the egg come before the chicken?": and so it is with these events and changes, that have
        occurred in my life.

I've always wanted to be married, have a family; but it would be many years, seemingly, before I would be wed to my wife (and understandingly, now, she's a few years younger than I).  I am reminded of <i>Proverbs 5:19; and 18:22</i> when I think of my wife.  My wife<img href="https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/12144654_837366469715255_3380612445852774677_n.jpg?oh=88e2ba8bdf7f7ad1f94a698533267108&oe=59E31139"/> Christine, is one of the greatest occurences outside of salvation, that has happened in my life.  She is my rock, Whom THE Rock of my Salvation has given me.  <img href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1310777159040848&set=pb.100003257306913.-2207520000.1496762329.&type=3&theater">She is such a great Mom!  <img href="MacOS/Users/SuperCodingNinja/Documents/mom_hero.jpg"></img>Our kids think so        </p>
